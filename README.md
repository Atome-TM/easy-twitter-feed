# easy-twitter-feed

1. Fill the required informations
2. Include in your project
3. Everything about your tweet(s) can be found in the $tweet variable
4. Alter (or not) your tweet by using the tweet_html_text function, which returns actual HTML links for hashtags, handlenames, and links.

You can use the time_elapsed_string function to get a readable string (currently in french, but there is an alternate array for english, just switch them up) of "x days/weeks/months/years". You can then manually add "ago" or "il y a" in your own code and therefore form a nice string.
